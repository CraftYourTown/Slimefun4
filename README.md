# This is our modification of Slimefun4 to be optimised for large servers. No support will be given by us or Slimefun for issues with this.
Our version simply adds an option for Advanced Output Nodes and Input Nodes to not check lores/names of items going through it as this is extremely heavy on the TPS when a lot of them are in use.
